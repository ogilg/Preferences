# Base configuration for held-one-out validation
# This template is used with run_held_one_out.py which automatically generates
# train/eval configs for each dataset fold. The _DATASET placeholder is removed
# to use a single unified manifest directory across all folds.
# All probes from all folds are stored in probe_data/manifests/probe_hoo/probes/
# with metadata tracking which fold each probe came from.
# Point experiment_dir to an existing experiment with measurements
