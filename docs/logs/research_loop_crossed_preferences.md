# Crossed Preferences Experiment

**Goal**: Determine whether preference probes (ridge L31, r=0.843 on hidden preferences) track content topics, task categories, or both. Test via crossed tasks that embed hidden topics in mismatched category shells (e.g., math problem about cheese). Also test subtle/unexpected preference manipulations.

**Success criteria**:
- Behavioral: >70% of crossed-task manipulations shift in expected direction
- Probe: Significant positive correlation (r > 0, p < 0.05) between behavioral and probe deltas for crossed tasks
- Category comparison: Can distinguish whether probe tracks content, category, or both

**Result**: (pending)

## Design

8 hidden topics × 5 category shells = 40 crossed tasks. Category shells: math, coding, fiction, content_generation, harmful.

16 pure reference tasks from hidden_preferences included for direct comparison.

System prompts: 48 iteration + 24 holdout from hidden_preferences, plus 24 new subtle prompts (16 for existing topics with indirect expression, 8 for 4 new unusual topics).

## Baseline

(pending — will fill after behavioral measurement)
