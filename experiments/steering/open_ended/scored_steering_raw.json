Instead of relying on hard-coded rules, algorithms are designed to identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time as they're exposed to more data. This learning happens through various techniques like supervised learning (learning from labeled data), unsupervised learning (discovering patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error). Ultimately, machine learning empowers computers to solve complex problems and automate tasks that traditionally required human intelligence, from spam filtering and image recognition to medical diagnosis and self-driving cars."

You can add, remove, or modify elements.\n* **Tuples are Immutable:** Once a tuple is created, you *cannot* change its contents.  You can't add, remove, or modify elements.
