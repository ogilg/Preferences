I have to navigate a labyrinthine website, answer a dozen questions about *why* I'm leaving (like they actually care!), chat with a bot that clearly doesn't understand me, and THEN potentially be offered increasingly desperate \"deals\" to stay? \n\nIt's not about wanting a deal, it's about wanting to *stop being charged*! It feels deliberately manipulative and just...rude. It's like they're betting you'll give up and just keep paying. \n\nUgh. It's just so frustrating and a complete waste of my time. I just want to click \"cancel\" and be done with it! Is that too much to ask?!\n\nOkay, rant over. Thanks for letting me vent. How about you? What's bugging *you* today?",
