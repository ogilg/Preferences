What is the probability that it is an odd number (3,5,7,9) or a $\\spadesuit$ (or both)?assistant\n\nTo find the probability of drawing an odd number card (3,5,7,9) or a $\\spadesuit$ or both from a standard 52-card deck, we first need to calculate the number of cards that satisfy these conditions and then divide by the total number of cards.\n\n1. Total number of cards in the deck: 52\n2. Cards that are odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 9): There are 4 suits for each odd number (hearts, diamonds, spades, clubs). So, there are 4 * 4 = 16 odd number cards.\n3. Total number of spade cards: There are 13 cards in each suit, and we only want spades, so there are 13 spade cards.\n\nNow, let's consider the overlapping or combined cases where these two conditions occur:\n- Some of the odd number cards are spades (3 of spades, 5 of spades, 7 of spades, 9 of spades) So, we have 4 cards.\n\nWe now need to add up the number of cards that are odd or spades or both and subtract the overlap to prevent double counting. This can be done using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal number of cards that are odd or $\\spadesuit$ or both: \n(16 odd number cards) + (13 spade cards) - (4 cards that are both) = 16 + 13 - 4 = 25\n\n4 value cards are shared among odd and spade criteria in the above calculation and that number is the overlap of these two different criteria.\n\n\nOK \nTo find the probability of drawing an odd number card or a $\\spadesuit$ card or both, divide the total number of desired outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe probability is 25/52.\n\nTo simplify 25/52 into a simpler fraction, find the greatest common divisor of 25 and 52, which is 1.\nSimplify 25 / 52 to 25/ 52",

Then we have\n$\\tan^{-1} (x) + \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\tan^{-1}(x)\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ which becomes\n$\\tan^{-1} (x)+\\frac{\\pi}{2}- \\tan^{-1}(x)=\\frac{\\pi }{2}$ and\n$-\\tan^{-1} (x)+\\frac{\\pi}{2}=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ which becomes\n$\\tan^{-1} (x)=0.$ However we also have that the set of all solutions to the equation $\\tan^{-1}(y)=0$ is $\\{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\}$ while the range of the $\\tan^{-1}$ function is $\\left ( -\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$ and $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ is not in the range of this function so we include both $x$ and $\\frac{1}{x}$ to our final answer.\n\nThe values that $x$ and $\\frac{1}{x}$ can be to satisfy both of these are the elements that make $a=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $0$ and satisfy\n$\\cos \\left( -\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right)!=0$ in the usual sense but $\\tan^{-1}(x)=\\tan^{-1}0=0.$ However in the sense of inverse functions $\\cos \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) =0$, we allow both  solutions  $\\boxed{x=-1, x=1}$ to this  equation.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-1, 1}$",
