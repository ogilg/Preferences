Commit staged and unstaged changes in reasonable, logical chunks.

## Process

1. **Survey changes**: Run `git status` and `git diff --stat` to see all modified, staged, and untracked files. Read diffs to understand the nature of each change.

2. **Group into logical chunks**:

3. **Commit each chunk**

4. **Verify**: Run `git status` at the end to confirm the final state. Report what was committed and what was intentionally left uncommitted.
