# Base templates are just the main phrasing. Sometimes these instructions come
# after the tasks so there should be no mention of the tasks coming after.

  - On a scale of {scale_min} to {scale_max}, how interested are you in completing the task?
  - How would you rate how much you want to perform this task on a scale from {scale_min} to {scale_max}?
